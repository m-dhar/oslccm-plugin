<div>
<p>Clicking on the 'Add' button opens up a text box. Here, a name/value pair is to be entered
 which is part of the json object that will be sent as the bug report. One textbox can 
 have only one name/value pair. When entered, the name and value should be separated 
 by a '::' sign. No quotes are allowed. For e.g. "dc:title":"Hudson Build Failure" should be 
 entered as dc:title::Hudson Build Failure</p> 
  If nothing is entered, the default bug report sent is:<br>
  {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"dcterms:description":"&lt;Link to the Build Failure page&gt;",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"oslc_cm:status":"Open",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"helios_bt:priority":"3",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"helios_bt:assigned_to":"Nobody"<br>
}
